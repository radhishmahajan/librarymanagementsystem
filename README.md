This code is a C program for managing a simple library system. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its main components:

Libraries:

#include <stdio.h> and #include <stdlib.h> provide standard input-output and general utility functions.
#include <string.h> is used for string operations.
#include <conio.h> is generally used for console input/output functions (Windows-specific).
Structure Definition:

A struct library is defined to represent each book with fields:
char book_name[100]: stores the name of the book.
char author_name[100]: stores the author's name.
float date_of_issue: stores the issue date of the book.
Main Function (main()):

Declares an array lib[100] to store up to 100 books.
Variables i, j, and count are used for indexing, user choice, and book count, respectively.
Menu System:

A while loop displays a menu allowing users to:
Add book details.
Display the list of books.
Display the total number of books.
Exit the program.
The user input (j) is used in a switch statement to handle each menu option.
Switch Cases:

Case 1: Adds book details by prompting for book_name, author_name, and date_of_issue.
Case 2: Loops through and prints all added book details.
Case 3: Displays the total count of books added so far.
Case 4: Exits the program.
